# bing-geocode-accessor
PoC code to use Bing Spatial Services geocoding API using Python. 

This will be very much just exploratory / PoC code to learn how to use the API,
nothing fancy or production ready. 

I am aware of the [Geocoder Python package](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/geocoder).

However, it seems to me the package only supports geocoding one entry at a
time. I want to learn how to use the [Bing Geocoding Dataflow
API](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff701733.aspx)  to create batch
geocoding jobs and retrieve the results. 

## Status as of 2017-02-25

There is a somewhat working Python implementation. Parts of it were included in
this repository but as the code included hard-coded secrets etc, a chunk of
stuff was just removed and the file uploaded broken. So the current file is not
functional, will fix this soon.
