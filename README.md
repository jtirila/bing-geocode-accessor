# bing-geocode-accessor
PoC code to use Bing Spatial Services geocoding API using Python. 

This will be very much just exploratory / PoC code to learn how to use the API, nothing fancy or production ready. 

I am aware of the [Geocoder Python package](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/geocoder).

However, it seems to me the package only supports geocoding one entry at a time. I want to learn how to use the [Bing Geocoding Dataflow API](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff701733.aspx)  to create batch geocoding jobs and retrieve the results.
